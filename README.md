- yarn

## <span id="techused">Technologies used</span>

## <span id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</span>

#### 1. Fork the repo

Click the fork button at the top right of the page to create a copy of this repo in your account, or go to the [Japahub-frontend fork page](https://github.com/japahubs/japahubs-frontend/fork).

After successfully forking the repo, you will be directed to your repo copy.

#### 2. Clone the forked repo

On your forked repo, click the button that says `Code`. It will open a dropdown menu. Copy the link in the input with the label `HTTPS` or `GitHub CLI` depending on your preferred cloning mode.

For HTTPS, open up your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone <your-clone-link>
# or
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/japahubs-frontend.git
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

You can also clone the repo using the GitHub CLI. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone <your-username>/japahubs-frontend
```

#### 3. Set up the project

To set up the project, navigate into the project directory and open up the project in your preferred code editor.

Install the dependencies using yarn. You'll need to have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) installed; please take a look at the [prerequisite](#prerequisite) section.

```bash
yarn install
```

## <span id="makechanges">Making your Changes</span>

You are to make only one contribution per pull request. It makes it easier to review and merge. If you have multiple bug fixes or features, create separate pull requests for each.

#### 1. Create a new branch

Create a new branch from the `dev` branch. Your branch name should be descriptive of the changes you are making. E.g., `feat/profile-settings`. Some ideas to get you started:

- For Feature Updates: `feat/profile-settings`
- For Bug Fixes: `fix/profile-settings`

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>

```

#### 2. Run the project

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### 3. Commit Message

Your commit message should give a concise idea of the issue you are solving. It should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, as this helps us generate the project changelog automatically.

- feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
- fix: A bug fix
- style: Feature and updates related to styling
- refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
- test: Everything related to testing
- docs: Everything related to documentation
- chore: Regular code maintenance.

A traditional structure of commit looks like so:

```bash
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

Eg:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Implement sidebar component"
```

To commit your changes, run the following command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

Push your local commits to your remote repository

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

## Create a new [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Go to the [Japahubs-frontend repository](https://github.com/japahubs/japahubs-frontend/tree/dev) and click the `compare & pull request` button or go to the [Pull Request page](https://github.com/japahubs/japahubs-frontend/pulls) and click on the `New pull request` button. It will take you to the `Open a pull request` page.

> Note: Make sure your PR points to the `dev` branch, not any other one.
